								<a class="image fit" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/Jive.png" alt="" /></a>
								<br />
								<p>
									Music has a unique ability to draw people together. Listening to music with others allows people to grow closer to each other as they express themselves through sharing the music they are passionate about. In a digital age, it is rare that people enjoy face-to-face interactions with each other, especially when listening to and sharing music with one another. Although there is a time and place for digital interaction, being in the presence of others forges a special connection that no digital connection can generate. Justin realized this and observed that there was no app that allowed people to be brought together to enjoy listening and sharing music with each other.
								</p>

								<p>
									As an avid musician and lover of music, Justin is the sole creator, designer, and developer of the Jive app. Jive is a unique music sharing app that draws people together through their shared love for music. Jive is a music app that allows users to create local parties for friends to join. These parties allow users to queue up music to a playlist to listen to with others. Local parties in Jive require the hostâs phone to play the music, encouraging friends to enjoy music while together. Whether on a road trip with a small group of friends or at a house party with hundreds of new people, a host can create a Jive party for anyone and everyone nearby to join and add songs to.
								</p>

								<p>
									Although the party host can choose to control what kind of music is played and who is invited to the party, Jive is an app brings the power to the people, letting party members choose what songs they want to listen to and what songs they want to skip. If a song feels out of place, any member of the party can choose to vote out a song, and if a song gets enough votes, the song is skipped.
								</p>

								<p>
									Jive is a mobile app that will soon be available for both iOS and Android devices. Jive was programmed in React Native, uses Redux for state management, and leverages a Firebase database. Â

								<a class="image fit" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<br />
								<p>
									As a part of his Masterâs of Science degree in Information Studies while at the University of Texas at Austin, Justin was given the opportunity to design a mobile application for <a target="_blank" href="https://thezaky.com/">The Zaky</a>. The Zaky is a product developed by NurturedByDesign which allows newborn mothers to care for their babies by ensuring an easy and efficient means of creating skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their babies. The Zaky, a special type of Kangaroo Care device, is a cloth top worn by the mother that allows mothers to carry babies around hands-free in what looks like a kangaroo pouch. The Zaky is also fitted with a set of sensors that track the babyâs heart rate, respiration, body temperature, and amount of sleep. The mobile application for the Zaky was designed to connect to these sensors on the Zaky so that mothers can easily monitor the growth and development of their babies.
								</p>
								<p>
									Justin met with the President and CEO of NurturedByDesign in a client kickoff to learn more about NurturedByDesign, the Zaky, and the features of the desired mobile application. Justin analyzed the market and the target audience for the Zaky app, observing existing applications used to track the growth and development of newborn babies. From this market analysis, Justin examined the feature sets of the existing applications on the market in a competitive analysis through which he formulated a minimally viable product feature set for the application.

								<div class="modal-image-container">
									<div class="modal-image">
										<img src="images/comp-evals.png" />
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>
									Justin designed a set of rough sketch-ups which were used as the basis for a set of low fidelity designs of the app. These low fidelity screens were pieced together into a low fidelity prototype that was used by a set of users in a user research study.
								</p>

								<div class="modal-screen-container">

										<img src="images/lofi1.png"/>
									</div>
									<div class="modal-screen right">
										<img src="images/lofi2.png"/>
									</div>
								</div>

								<p>
									In this user research study, four newborn mothers interacted with the low fidelity prototype. During these user studies, these users were observed as they navigated through a set of hypothetical scenarios in which they had to utilize the low fidelity prototype to accomplish a set of actions, such as logging breastfeeding, utilizing the timer, and sending important information to healthcare professionals. From these tests, results were used to improve the design of the app to be more efficient and intuitive.
								</p>
								<p>
									The set of low fidelity designs were augmented and improved to create high fidelity designs which were pieced together into a final prototype. During the process of improving the low fidelity designs, colors, fonts, and icons were added to the designs.
								</p>
								<p>
									During the process of designing the Zaky App, Sketch was used to design each of the screens of the app and Invision was used to piece together the screens into an interactive and largely functional prototype.

								<h2 class="text-uppercase align-center">NSF HURRICANE HARVEY PROJECT</h2>
								<a class="image fit" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/harvey.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									As a part of the Computational Media Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, Justin conducts research as a manager and developer in the Hurricane Harvey Project. This project is aimed at developing a tool that utilizes machine learning in order to dynamically identify individuals in need of disaster help. In late 2017, in light of Hurricane Harvey, Justin was approached by Dr. Dhiraj Murthy to put together a small team of researchers that could utilize their knowledge of programming to make a difference in future natural disasters by providing a tool for rescuers to locate those in need.
								</p>
								<p>
									Justin and his team trained a machine learning model with real social media data posted during the time of Hurricane Harvey. This tool leverages computer vision to train the machine learning model. Each piece of media is specifically classified as signal, media posted by a Harvey rescuee or a rescuer, or noise, media unrelated to Harvey or relief efforts.
								</p>
								<p>
									The goal of the project is to create foundational models that can be utilized by public safety and disaster relief agencies and be built into existing social media web scapers/data mining systems to locate people in need of rescue during disasters.
								</p>
								<p>
									The NSF Harvey project is a Python tool that utilizes libraries such as the Stanford LDA toolkit, sci-kit-learn, and panda libraries. NSF also utilizes the Twitter extraction API to extract noise data and the Google Vision API to leverage Google Visionâs label classification system.

								<h2 class="text-uppercase align-center">IMMERSIVE JOURNALISM</h2>
								<a class="image fit" data-toggle="modal"><img src="images/immerj.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
									Virtual reality technologies are taking the world by storm and are revolutionizing many industries as we know them, with the journalism industry being one of these industries. Much of modern journalism is conducted digitally in the form of text stories or 2D image/video content. However, virtual reality has added a new dimension of interactivity to journalism stories. Through virtual reality, journalists can tell 360 degree panoramic stories, stories that completely immerse the viewer so as to give the viewer the ability to actually experience the story and its various perspectives firsthand.
								</p>
								<p>
									Unfortunately, because virtual reality is a highly technical field and is still quite new, creating 360 degree panoramic stories in virtual reality is too technically advanced for most journalists, requiring robust knowledge and skill in game engine development, image processing, and programming. Justin served as one of the lead developers and researchers in a project known as Immersive Journalism, a collaborative effort between the UT School of Journalism, journalists at the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center Visualization Lab to design and implement a tool that enables journalists to create captivating virtual reality stories as 360Â° panoramic scenes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Immersive Journalism, much like WordPress does to the process of creating websites, dumbs down the process of creating virtual reality stories. Immersive Journalism requires little to no technical knowledge or expertise to use and allows journalists to create virtual reality stories in just minutes.  Justin took one of the lead roles in testing the Immersive Journalism application with professional journalists from the Washington Post and the New York Times through a series of user studies. These one-on-one studies enabled Justin and the other researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to specifically tailor the Immersive Journalism program to the needs and workflow of journalists.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since its creation, the beta version of Immersive Journalism has been utilized by various organizations both for the creation of some of the worldâs first true virtual reality journalist stories. In addition, Stanford University has recently adopted the Immersive Journalism tool into one of their journalism courses as a means for new journalists to practice creating immersive content. Justin and the team published a <a target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7892329/">paper</a> to the 2017 IEEE-VR conference outlining their research and development.
								</p>
								<p>
									Immersive Journalism was a tool built on top of Unity 3D. Justin specifically lead development on the NodeJS wrapper application that allows users to manage, save, and load their projects into Unity. Once a project is in Unity, the Immersive Journalism application front end overlays the Unity front end, abstracting away the complexity of the interface into a handful of easy-to-use buttons. Immersive Journalism was programmed in C# and NodeJS.
